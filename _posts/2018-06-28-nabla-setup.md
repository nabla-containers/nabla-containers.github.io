Earlier, we introduced [Nabla Containers]({{'/' | relative_url}}). In this article we will show how you can get started with Nabla-containers! We will go through the build and installation process, and get you started on running your first nabla container - in 3 simple steps! In the following articles, we will show how you can create your own nabla containerized `node.js` and `python` applications!

This article assumes a linux machine with golang and docker. But if you don't have that, we have provided instructions in the appendix to create a ubuntu VM as our development machine (but of course, you don't have to!).

## Step 1: Let's build and install runnc

`runnc` is the runtime for nabla containers. It serves the same purpose of `runc` for standard linux containers. Before we are able to run nabla containers, we need to have it installed.

First, we get the go repository:

```
# Set our GOPATH (If you don't already have one)
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ mkdir -p ~/go
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ export GOPATH=~/go
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ go get github.com/nabla-containers/runnc
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/nabla-containers/runnc
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~/go/src/github.com/nabla-containers/runnc$ ls
AUTHORS          Dockerfile.build  Makefile   README.md   ... <TRUNCATED>...
```

Next, we go ahead to build the binaries needed. `runnc` has a containerized build which has all the build dependencies in a docker image! So building the binaries should be as easy as a `make container-build` (assuming `docker` is installed). If your dev environment doesn't have docker or is already a docker container, you may follow the directions on the README (https://github.com/nabla-containers/runnc) in runnc.

```
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~/go/src/github.com/nabla-containers/runnc$ make container-build
sudo docker build . -f Dockerfile.build -t runnc-build
Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.128 MB

install -m 775 -D solo5/ukvm/ukvm-bin build/nabla-run
```
We should see that the following files exist:

```
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~/go/src/github.com/nabla-containers/runnc$ ls -l build/
total 7268
-rwxrwxr-x 1 root root  170960 Jun 22 14:23 nabla-run
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2696096 Jun 22 14:23 runnc
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4568704 Jun 22 14:23 runnc-cont
```

Now let's install `runnc`, using `make container-install`.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~/go/src/github.com/nabla-containers/runnc$ make container-install
sudo docker build . -f Dockerfile.build -t runnc-build

Copying /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 to /opt/runnc/lib/
```

We should verify that the following files exist:

```
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~/go/src/github.com/nabla-containers/runnc$ ls -l /usr/local/bin
total 7268
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  170960 Jun 22 14:33 nabla-run

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4568704 Jun 22 14:33 runnc-cont

total 2080

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  280872 Jun 22 14:33 libseccomp.so.2
```

## Step 2: Installing the runtime for docker

Before we go ahead, we need to install some runtime pre-requisites.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~/go/src/github.com/nabla-containers/runnc$ sudo apt install -y genisoimage
... <TRUNCATED>...
```

Finally, we go ahead to configure docker to use our runtime. This can be done by editing the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file. By default, there is not configuration, so we just add the file.

NOTE: if you have custom runtimes already installed, we recommend modifying the file yourself.

```
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~/go/src/github.com/nabla-containers/runnc$ cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "runnc": {
                "path": "/usr/local/bin/runnc"
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, we just restart the docker daemon to apply the new configuration:

```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```


## Step 3: Creating our first nabla container
Let's go ahead to start our first nabla container:
```
$ sudo docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --runtime=runnc nablact/node-express-nabla &

```

We can then access this on our localhost:

```
$ curl localhost:8080
Nabla!
```

Stay tuned for the next article on how to create `node.js` and  `python` nabla containerized applications.


## Appendix: Setting up a Linux VM with golang and docker.

Note that if you want to perform a more advanced setup (i.e. with k8s - you may need more memory and disk than the default.

We set up a dev VM using vagrant:

```
$ vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> default: Importing base box 'ubuntu/xenial64'...
... <TRUNCATED>...
$ vagrant ssh
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ sudo apt update
