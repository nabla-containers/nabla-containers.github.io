title: "Go over Nabla: App Safety meets Host Isolation"
---

This blog presents how an application written in Golang can be built and run as a Nabla container.
We take an example of a web server application, part of the [nabla-demo-apps](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-demo-apps) repository.
To enable/port Go over Nabla, we also briefly present certain key modifications made to the Go runtime.



### Application build
The httpd example highlights Nabla's support for Go applications organized across multiple .go files, multiple packages, as well as third-party package imports from github.

In the [sample code](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-demo-apps/tree/master/go-httpd/src), the `main()` function in httpd.go uses a utility function from the helper package (helper/process_args.go) to parse the commandline arguments. 
After some trivial commandline parsing, the webserver listens for HTTP GET commands on port 3000 from the outside world.

Building this Go webserver as a Nabla container is pretty straightforward. 
[Dockerfile.Nabla](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-demo-apps/blob/master/go-httpd/Dockerfile.nabla) lists the steps required for a multi-stage build of the Go app.
A typical image build with ```docker build -t go-httpd-nabla -f Dockerfile.nabla .``` performs the following operations:
1. First, the app's source directory is added to the [`nabla-go-base`](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-base-build/tree/master/go-base) image, which contains the Go runtime ported over Nabla (see Section 'Under the Covers'). 
2. This is followed by the usual `go get` of the dependencies.
3. After this, a generic [Makefile.Goapp](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-base-build/blob/master/go-base/Makefile.goapp) (part of the base image itself) is triggered, which builds the Go app as a static Nabla binary.
4. The resulting binary then becomes the entrypoint of the Go app Nabla container, which can be run using the [`runnc`](https://github.com/nabla-containers/runnc) Nabla-container runtime as `docker run -it --rm --runtime=runnc go-httpd-nabla random-arg1 random-arg2`. An expected output would look something like:

```

### Under the covers
This Section describes certain internal details behind Nabla's Go port, and assumes some familiarity with the Rumprun unikernel (one of the Library OSes Nabla supports).
The Nabla Go base is built on top of [Gorump](https://github.com/deferpanic/gorump), a port of Go for Rumprun.
Nabla currently supports Go-1.5.1, one of the two versions supported by Gorump.

Gorump modifies Go to add a new supported 'GOOS'- rumprun.
Although this enables running Go applications as unikernel VMs, they can't be run as-is as a Nabla container, unlike [python](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-base-build/tree/master/python3-base) or [node](https://github.com/nabla-containers/nabla-base-build/tree/master/node-base) applications.
This happens because Go runtime's requirement on platform-specific Thread Local Storage (TLS), is at odds with the host system interface Nabla permits to offer increased container isolation.
Specifically, the Go runtime uses TLS to store a pointer to a 'G' structure containing internal details specific to each individual Go routine (a nice description can be found [here](https://blog.altoros.com/Golang-internals-part-3-the-linker-and-object-files.html)).
In AMD64, the TLS implementation translates to setting segment registers (FS/GS). The corresponding syscall to access these registers (`arch_prctl(ARCH_SET_FS,..)` in Linux, `_lwp_setprivate()` in BSD) is not part of the default Nabla seccomp policy<sup>1</sup>.
While it could be added, the resulting impact on system isolation would need to be explored, which is a non-trivial task.

Another alternative is to handle TLS in software (potentially at a performance cost).
Our port of Go on Nabla uses this approach, by using the POSIX `pthread_setspecific()` interface (managed inside rumprun) to provide TLS to the Go runtime.
The corresponding changes made to Gorump can be found in the [solo5](https://github.com/nabla-containers/gorump/tree/solo5) branch of Nabla's Gorump fork.


<sup>1 Other TLS implementations, such as modify_ldt() for i386 architectures, and set_thread_area(), would also require expanding Nabla's seccomp policy to allow the respective syscalls.
