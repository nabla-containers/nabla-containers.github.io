title: The Choices We Make
---

The common theme behind all the container runtime alternatives--Kata, Gvisor and Nabla--is to improve container isolation.
However, to achieve the same goal, each solution adopts a different approach. 
Kata employes the virtual machine isolation, Gvisor the xxx sandbox [TODO], and Nabla the libOS+Seccomp based attack surface minimzation.

In this blog post, we highlight the impact of a key design choice difference between Nabla and Kata containers--the *touch points* into the host kernel from a filesystem perspective.

Nabla uses a LibOS-powered filesystem interface, whereas Kata directly uses the host's [filesystem interface](https://github.com/kata-containers/documentation/blob/master/architecture.md#storage), exposed via the [9p](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/9p.txt) protocol<sup>1</sup>.
This means that Kata has more kernel *touch points* (filesystem and block device components), as compared to Nabla (block device only).
And thus, in case of the former, there is a greater probability of hitting a kernel bug, or exploiting a vulnerability.


### Kernel Oops!
We highlight this by a recently discovered bug in the ext4 filesystem code- [CVE-2018-10840] (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10840).
In this case, removing the [extended attributes](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/attr.5.html) of a file on a crafted ext4 image, leads to a kernel oops due to a buffer overflow.
The culprit syscall which allows a userspace program to trigger this bug is `removexattr()`.
When testing with a Ubuntu 18.04<sup>2</sup> host system, we were able to trigger this bug in the kernel, from inside a Kata container.
The following video shows a demo of this.

[TODO: video]


### The Bug
We used the [original author's] (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199347) crafted image to test this bug, which can be exposed with the following simple trigger code:

```
// mpoint is the path to the mounted crafted image
static void activity(char *mpoint) {
  char *xattr;
  int err = asprintf(&xattr, "%s/foo/bar/xattr", mpoint);
  char buf2[113];
  memset(buf2, 0, sizeof(buf2));
  listxattr(xattr, buf2, sizeof(buf2));
  removexattr(xattr, "user.mime_type");
}
```
The buffer overflow happens in kernel's `fs/ext4/xattr.c:ext4_xattr_set_entry() 
` function, because of a [missed check](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.15/source/fs/ext4/xattr.c#L1671) on the size parameter of the [`memmove()`] (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memmove.3.html) function, which is negative when trying to remove the extended attribute (`user.mime_type`) for the file `foo/bar/xattr` in the crafted image. 
The [fix] (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=276147&action=diff) is fairly straightforward in this case.



### Nabla lucky? (and GVisor?)
Nabla's philosophy of limiting access to host kernel means that a container's filesystem access would be handled inside the LibOS and never reach the host kernel. 
Thus, this bug would never get triggered<sup>3</sup>, even if the host kernel is vulnerable, since `removexattr()` is not in nabla's seccomp-allowed [profile] (https://github.com/nabla-containers/solo5/blob/ukvm-linux-seccomp/ukvm/ukvm_hv_linux.c#L53-L106).
Or in other words- it's philosophy, not luck!

The bug does not surface in case of Gvisor as well.
However, it does not seem like a security feature, as [indicated](https://github.com/google/gvisor/blob/master/pkg/sentry/syscalls/linux/linux64.go#L239-L250) by Sentry's lack of support for `removexattr()`-- `// Removexattr, requires filesystem support`.


### So what?
This particular bug doesn't present a serious security vulnerability in a container setting, since:
(i) it needs a crafted image to be exposed as rootfs or a volume to the containers,
(ii) the end product of a successful exploit means only a killed process within the adversary container,
(ii) the kernel remains functional despite the bug being triggered.

But it does serve as an example of what's possible when various 'touch points' into the host kernel are available, and the need to minimize them. 
Even from a filesystem *touch-point* perspecive, we cannot eliminate the existence of [bugs](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/syzkaller/_8MZkKL2-QU/PA0q5XULEAAJ) that do not require a crafted image, as well as the potential of [bugs](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96971) causing a full kernel panic, or serious side-effects such as [privilege escalation](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1328).

In this blog, although we chose the filesystem interface to highlight Nabla's *touch-point* (attack surface) minimization philosophy, the same is applicable to other components as well, including the virtulaization interface itself!

To summarize: even though the goal is the same (container isolation), the design choice differences matter--its about the 'principles' ;) 



<sup>1 Kata does use a block device interface for its containers, when Docker is configured to use the [`devicemapper'](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/) storage driver.

<sup>2 Ubuntu latest kernel in use- -`4.15.0-38-generic` contains the patch for this bug. We used Ubuntu's `4.15.0-29-generic` kernel to trigger this bug.

<sup>3 For complete transparency, `removexattr()` would not work in Nabla as of today, since support for writable filesystem is not fully complete. Contributers welcome! [TODO: ricardo]
